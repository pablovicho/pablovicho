## I'm Pablo, a fullstack javascript developer.

- I'm currently working on a personal project based on **REMIX**, as a learning experience of both Remix and **TypeScript**.
- I'm also working on a Boggle clone! Fun fact: I *love* word games 🤓.
- I'm looking to collaborate with amazing web projects in a fast environment rich with learning experience.
- If you like anything you see, contact me here, or at my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablovicho/) profile!
